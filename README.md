## Project Overview

This project includes two separate tasks:

1. **Predicting Turbine Energy Yield (TEY):** A machine learning model is developed to predict the turbine energy yield using ambient variables as features.

2. **Predicting Burned Area of Forest Fires:** A neural network model is created to predict the burned area of forest fires.

The project involves data exploration, data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning for both tasks.

## Dataset

### Task 1: Turbine Energy Yield Prediction
- Dataset: `gas_turbines.csv`
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning

### Task 2: Forest Fire Burned Area Prediction
- Dataset: `forestfires.csv`
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- keras (for neural network)
- tensorflow (for neural network)

You can install them using `pip install`.

## Usage

1. Download the respective datasets: `gas_turbines.csv` and `forestfires.csv`.

2. Run the code provided in the corresponding sections of the project structure.

3. Explore the README file to understand the process, visualizations, and results for each task.

4. Use the code as a starting point for similar modeling projects.
